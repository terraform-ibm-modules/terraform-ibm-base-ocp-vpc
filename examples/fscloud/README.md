# Financial Services compliant example

This example uses the [Profile for IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-base-ocp-vpc/tree/main/modules/fscloud) to provision an instance of the base OCP VPC module in a compliant manner.

The following resources are provisioned by this example:
- A new resource group, if an existing one is not passed in.
- A Cloud Object Storage instance.
- An Object Storage bucket (for VPC Flow logs).
- A secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- An IBM Cloud Monitoring (Sysdig) instance.
- An IBM Cloud Activity Tracker instance, if existing ones is not passed in.
- A context-based restriction (CBR) rule to only allow COS Instance to be accessible from within the VPC.
- An OCP cluster in a VPC with the default worker pool deployed across 3 availability zones with cluster and boot volume encrypted with the given Hyper Protect Crypto Service root key.

:exclamation: **Important:** OCP provisions a COS bucket, but you cannot use your own encryption keys. This will fail the requirement for Cloud Object Storage to be enabled with customer-managed encryption and Keep Your Own Key (KYOK). In OCP 4.14, COS will become optional to provision a cluster.

## Before you begin

- You need a Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance and keys for the worker and master encryption available in the region that you want to deploy your OCP Cluster instance to.
