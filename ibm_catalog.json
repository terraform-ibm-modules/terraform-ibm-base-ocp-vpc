Thus, it helps ensure seamless storage integration.<br><br>Users can select from predefined cluster sizes — <b>mini (default), small, medium, and large.</b> The chosen size determines the <b>machine type</b> of the worker nodes, <b>the number of availability zones</b> the cluster spans, and <b>number of worker nodes</b> deployed in each zone. To get more information on this, refer [here](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-base-ocp-vpc/blob/main/solutions/quickstart/DA_docs.md).<br><br>By default, the architecture provisions a <b>two-zone VPC</b>, forming the foundation for the OpenShift cluster. The cluster comprises a single worker pool distributed across these zones, with <b>two worker nodes per zone</b> in the mini configuration.<br><br>This streamlined architecture balances ease of use with flexibility, enabling rapid OpenShift cluster deployments with the infrastructure, integrated storage services, and right-sized compute resources of IBM Cloud."
