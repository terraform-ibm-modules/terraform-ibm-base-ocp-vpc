# Landing zone for containerized applications with OpenShift - Standard (Integrated setup with configurable services) variation

{: #ocp-fully-configurable}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-industry="Banking,FinancialSector"}

{: toc-compliance="FedRAMP"}
{: toc-version="3.58.2 "}

Landing zone for containerized applications with OpenShift provides a scalable, secure, and production-ready foundation for deploying containerized applications on IBM Cloud. It comes integrated by default with several IBM Cloud services to enhance security, observability, and compliance. Data encryption is enforced using Key Protect and Key Management Services (KMS), while Cloud Object Storage (COS) supports persistent storage and acts as the internal image registry. Secrets Manager is used to securely manage sensitive credentials and certificates, ensuring tighter control over access and authentication. Observability is delivered through Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logs, and Activity Tracker, while regulatory compliance is supported via Security and Compliance Center and Workload Protection. These integrated capabilities work together to deliver a resilient and well-governed OpenShift environment.

The solution provisions a Red Hat OpenShift cluster within an IBM Cloud VPC, using a default three-zone configuration for high availability. It deploys a single worker pool across all zones, with two worker nodes per zone by default, and allows easy scaling through configurable variables. Cluster and boot volume encryption are enforced, and a dedicated object storage bucket is required to host the internal image registry. This setup ensures strong data protection and infrastructure reliability from the start.

While this architecture is designed to function independently, it also serves as a flexible foundation for more advanced use cases. It supports seamless integration with Cloud Automation for Red Hat OpenShift AI, enabling organizations to deploy AI-driven workloads and accelerate innovation. With its secure, extensible design and managed cloud services, the solution helps enterprises reduce operational complexity and deliver critical applications faster within a governed Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem.
