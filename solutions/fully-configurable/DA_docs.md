# Configuring complex inputs for OCP in IBM Cloud projects

Several optional input variables in the Red Hat Openshift Cluster [Deployable Architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#deployable_architecture) use complex object types. You can specify these inputs when you configure your Deployable Architectures (DA).

- [Add-ons](#options-with-addons) (`addons`)
- [Manage All Add-ons](#manage-all-add-ons) (`manage_all_addons`)
- [Additional Worker Pools](#options-with-additional-worker-pools) (`additional_worker_pools`)
- [Worker Pool Taints](#options-with-worker-pools-taints) (`worker_pools_taints`)
- [Additional VPE Security IDs](#options-with-additional-vpe-security-group-ids) (`additional_vpe_security_group_ids`)
- [Context Based Restrictions](#options-with-cbr) (`cbr_rules`)

## Options with Add-ons <a name="options-with-addons"></a>

This variable configuration allows you to specify which Red Hat OpenShift add-ons to install on your cluster and the version of each add-on to use.

- Variable name: `addons`
- Type: An object representing Red Hat OpenShift cluster add-ons.
- Default value: An empty object (`{}`).

### Supported Add-ons

- `debug-tool` (optional): The Debug Tool add-on helps diagnose and troubleshoot cluster issues by running tests and gathering information, accessible through the Red Hat OpenShift console.

- `image-key-synchronizer` (optional): The Image Key Synchronizer add-on enables the deployment of containers using encrypted images by synchronizing image keys, ensuring only authorized users can access and run them.

- `openshift-data-foundation` (optional): The Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) add-on manages persistent storage for containerized applications with a highly available storage solution.

- `vpc-file-csi-driver` (optional): The Virtual Private Cloud File Container Storage Interface Driver add-on enables the creation of persistent volume claims for fast, flexible, network-attached, Network File System-based file storage for Virtual Private Cloud.

- `static-route` (optional): The Static Route add-on allows worker nodes to re-route response packets through a virtual private network or gateway to an Internet Protocol (IP) address in an on-premises data center.

- `cluster-autoscaler` (optional): The Cluster Autoscaler add-on automatically scales worker pools based on the resource demands of scheduled workloads.

- `vpc-block-csi-driver` (optional): The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver add-on enables snapshotting of storage volumes, allowing users to restore data from specific points in time without duplicating the volume.

- `ibm-storage-operator` (optional): The IBM Storage Operator add-on streamlines the management of storage configuration maps and resources in your cluster.

- `openshift-ai` (optional): The Red Hat OpenShift AI add-on enables quick deployment of Red Hat OpenShift AI on a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster in IBM Cloud.

Please refer to [this](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-supported-cluster-addon-versions) page for information on supported add-ons and their versions.

### Example for addons configuration

```hcl
{
  cluster-autoscaler = "1.0.4"
  openshift-data-foundation = "4.12.0"
  vpc-file-csi-driver = "1.1.0"
}
```

## Manage All Add-ons <a name="manage-addons"></a>

The variable `manage_all_addons` determines whether Terraform manages all add-ons in your cluster. This is crucial when working with add-ons.

- If set to `true`, Terraform will manage all add-ons. This includes updating and removing older versions if you specify a new version in the addons block.

- If set to `false`, Terraform will only manage the add-ons listed in the addons map, leaving any others unchanged.

## Options with additional_worker_pools <a name="options-with-additional-worker-pools"></a>

This variable defines the worker node pools for your OCP cluster, with each pool having its own configuration settings.

- `additional_security_group_ids` (optional): A list of security group IDs that are attached to the worker nodes for additional network security controls.

### Example for additional_worker_pools configuration

```hcl
[
  {
    pool_name                         = "logging"
    machine_type                      = "bx2.4x16"
    workers_per_zone                  = 1
    secondary_storage                 = "300gb.5iops-tier"
    operating_system                  = "REDHAT_9_64"

      {
        id = "0717-a4b3c2d1-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6" # pragma: allowlist secret
        zone = "us-south-1"
        cidr_block = " "10.10.10.0/24"
      },
      {
        id = "0717-b4c3d2e1-f5g6-h7i8-j9k0-l1m2n3o4p5q6" # pragma: allowlist secret
        zone = "us-south-2"
        cidr_block = "10.20.10.0/24"
      }
    ]
    pool_name                         = "zone-3"
    machine_type                      = "bx2.4x16"

  }
]
```

## Options with worker_pool_taints <a name="options-with-worker-pools-taints"></a>

This variable allows you to configure taints for your worker pools in your OCP cluster.

- Variable name: `worker_pools_taints`.
- Type: An map of list of object.
- Default value: `null`.

### Options for worker_pool_taints

- `all` (optional): This applies to all worker pools. Since it's empty (`[]`), no taints are applied globally.
- `default` (optional): Represents the default worker pool. It is also empty, meaning no taints are applied by default.
- `zone-1`(optional): Represents the taint applied to the zone-1 worker pool.
  - `key`(optional): The key of the taint that the pod will tolerate. It must match a taint key on a node.
  - `value`(optional): This is the value associated with the taint. The pod will tolerate only taints with the same key and value.
  - `effect`(optional): Defines what happens to pods that do not tolerate the taint: NoExecute â†’ If a pod does not have this toleration, it will be evicted from the node. This is useful for ensuring only specific workloads run on a node.

### Example for worker_pool_taints configuration

```hcl
{
  all     = []
  default = []
  zone-1 = [{
    key    = "dedicated"
    value  = "zone-1"
    effect = "NoExecute"
  }]
  zone-2 = [{
    key    = "dedicated"
    value  = "zone-2"
    effect = "NoExecute"
  }]
}
```

## Options with additional_vpe_security_group_ids <a name="options-with-additional-vpe-security-group-ids"></a>

This variable allows you to add extra security groups to the Virtual Private Endpoints (VPEs) that are created with your OCP cluster.

- Variable name: `additional_vpe_security_group_ids`.
- Type: An object representing a security group.

  api = ["r042-e36d58d8-cc9b-4cb6-99a7-d6544f79e584"]
}
```

## Options with cbr_rules <a name="options-with-cbr"></a>

This variable allows you to provide a rule for the target service to enforce access restrictions for the service based on the context of access requests. Contexts are criteria that include the network location of access requests, the endpoint type from where the request is sent, etc.

  rule_contexts= [{
      attributes = [
                {
                  name : "endpointType",
                  value : "private"
                },
                {
