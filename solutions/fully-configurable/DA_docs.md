# Configuring complex inputs for OCP in IBM Cloud projects

Several optional input variables in the OCP cluster [deployable architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog#deployable_architecture) use complex object types. You can specify these inputs when you configure your deployable architecture.

- [Addons](#options-with-addons) (`addons`)
- [Additional Worker Pools](#options-with-additional-worker-pools) (`additional_worker_pools`)
- [Worker Pool Taints](#options-with-worker-pools-taints) (`worker_pools_taints`)
- [Additional VPE Security IDs](#options-with-additional-vpe-security-group-ids) (`additional_vpe_security_group_ids`)
- [Context Based Restrictions](#options-with-cbr) (`cbr_rules`)

## Options with addons <a name="options-with-addons"></a>

This variable configuration allows you to specify which OCP add-ons to install on your cluster and which version of each add-on to use.

- Variable name: `addons`.
- Type: An object represting addons.
- Default value: An empty object (`{}`).

### Options for addons

- `debug-tool` (optional): The "debug-tool" add-on helps diagnose and troubleshoot cluster issues by running tests and gathering information, which can be accessed through the OpenShift console.
- `image-key-synchronizer` (optional): The Image Key Synchronizer add-on enables the deployment of containers using encrypted images by synchronizing image keys, ensuring that only authorized users can access and run the encrypted images.
- `openshift-data-foundation` (optional): To manage persistent storage for your containerized apps with the highly available OpenShift Data Foundation storage solution.
- `vpc-file-csi-driver` (optional): To create persistent volume claims for fast and flexible network-attached, NFS-based File Storage for VPC.
- `static-route` (optional): To create static routes that allow worker nodes to re-route response packets through a VPN or gateway to an IP address in an on-premises data center.
- `cluster-autoscaler` (optional): To automatically scale the worker pools in your cluster based on the sizing needs of your scheduled workloads.
- `vpc-block-csi-driver` (optional): To copy a storage volume's contents at a particular point in time without creating an entirely new volume.
- `ibm-storage-operator` (optional): To manage several storage configmaps and resources in your cluster.

### Example for addons configuration

## Options with worker_pool_taints <a name="options-with-worker-pools-taints"></a>

This variable allows you to configure taints for your worker pools in your OCP cluster.

- Variable name: `worker_pools_taints`.
- Type: An map of list of object.
- Default value: null (`null`).

### Options for worker_pool_taints

- `all` (optional): This applies to all worker pools. Since it's empty ([]), no taints are applied globally.
- `default` (optional): Represents the default worker pool. It is also empty, meaning no taints are applied by default.
- `zone-1`(optional): Represents the taint applied to the zone-1 worker pool.
  - `key`(optional): The key of the taint that the pod will tolerate. It must match a taint key on a node.
  - `value`(optional): This is the value associated with the taint. The pod will tolerate only taints with the same key and value.
  - `effect`(optional): Defines what happens to pods that do not tolerate the taint: NoExecute â†’ If a pod does not have this toleration, it will be evicted from the node. This is useful for ensuring only specific workloads run on a node.

### Example for worker_pool_taints configuration

```hcl
{
  all     = []
  default = []
  zone-1 = [{
    key    = "dedicated"
